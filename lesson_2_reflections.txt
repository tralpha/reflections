Reflect: Initializing a Repository
When a repository is initialized, a .git file is created. This is the file which stores all the meta data of that particular Git repository.
This is needed in order to track and store all possible changes which occur in a Git repository.

Reflect: Staging Area
The saging area is where files which are to be committed are added. It adds a lot of value, because instead of getting a screenshot of the while repository your working in, you can instead commit the files where you made the changes.

Reflect: Commit Size
The staging area is quite useful. It will help me check exactly whih changes I've made and which one's I'm ready to commit without actually committing the changes.

Reflect: When to Use Branches
Branches will be useful when I want to change something on my project, but want to do it maybe as a side project. This is maybe when I want to chane the language, or add an experimental featuer to my project.
And from there, I should keep in mind that I'll keep changing the website or project until it becomes good, and maybe I'll merge it.
