Reflect: Initializing a Repository
When a repository is initialized, a .git file is created. This is the file which stores all the meta data of that particular Git repository.
This is needed in order to track and store all possible changes which occur in a Git repository.

Reflect: Staging Area
The saging area is where files which are to be committed are added. It adds a lot of value, because instead of getting a screenshot of the while repository your working in, you can instead commit the files where you made the changes.
