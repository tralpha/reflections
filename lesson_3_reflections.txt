When would you like to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When I want more collaboration with other developers.

Reflect: Manual vs. Automatic Pull
I will always want to pull changes manually because some chnages in my public repository can be done by some other people, and I don't really want to it to mess around with my local repository.
